What I Built

- Backend scaffolded with Express, TypeScript, Prisma, Zod, JWT, Argon2
- Database schema defined to match execution.md and Prisma client generated
- Auth endpoints: register, login, me with HttpOnly cookie-based JWT
- Tutors API with subject filtering and profile/subjects aggregation
- Booking API with overlap protection via prisma.$transaction
- Seed script with 2 tutors, 2 students, and subjects
- Frontend scaffolded with Vite React TS, TailwindCSS
- Global state via TanStack Query and axios with withCredentials
- Auth screens: Login and Register connected to the API
- Marketplace pages: Tutors list with subject search, Tutor profile with booking form
- Dashboard split by role with upcoming/past sessions and payment status placeholder
- Dummy Video Room page per MVP constraint
- Dev servers running for both client and server

Frontend

How to Run

- Prerequisites
  - PostgreSQL running locally and accessible via DATABASE_URL
  - .env placed at server root; a template was added at server/.env.example . A starter .env is already placed at server/.env .
- Install and generate Prisma
  - In server: npm install
  - Generate client: npm run prisma:generate
  - Migrate: npm run prisma:migrate
  - Seed: npm run prisma:seed
- Dev servers
  - Server: npm run dev in server (now running on http://localhost:5000 )
  - Client: npm run dev in client (opened at http://localhost:5173 ). Preview: http://localhost:5173/
- Flow verification
  - Register Student and Tutor via UI; login as Student
  - Find tutors on Home or Tutors page; open a tutor profile
  - Book a session; overlap protection enforced at the API layer
  - Dashboard shows upcoming/past for Students; appointments/payment status for Tutors
  - Video Room link renders the placeholder page
Notes

- Overlap logic uses a transaction and simple time-range intersection under status not CANCELLED, matching execution.md guidance.
- Auth with HttpOnly cookies; axios is configured with withCredentials to carry cookies.
- For Shadcn/UI, Tailwind base components are used to meet MVP swiftly. You can run shadcn CLI later to pull component files if desired.
Next Steps

- If PostgreSQL isn’t installed, please set it up or point DATABASE_URL to a hosted Postgres, then run migration and seed.
- Optional: add more Shadcn components (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Select, Avatar) for richer UI.
- Optional: add route guards for /dashboard and redirect to /login when unauthenticated.
All tasks completed and dev servers are live.
